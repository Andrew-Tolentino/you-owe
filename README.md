## YouOwe
YouOwe is an expense tracking web application that people can use to keep tabs of expenses during group outings. Users can anonymously create Groups and invite others to join. Users within a group can add expenses they made which will appear in real-time for others in the group to see. Once the outing is over, users can see the list of expenses other users have made to know their total amount of expenses.
